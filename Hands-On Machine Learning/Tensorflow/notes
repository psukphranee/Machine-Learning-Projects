Building MLP with Keras. Keras is a high level API that works with Tensorflow.
In this project we'll build a model that predicts the type of clothing article. There will be 10 categories to classify each sample into. We first load the Fashion MNIST dataset using keras.

The data is already split into training and test sets. We'll extract a subset of the training set for validation. 

I. Building an Image Classifier

Fashion MNIST 70,000; 28x28; 10 classes

    A. Using Keras to load the dataset

    28x28 images. pixes 0-225. 
    use Gradient Descent => normalize intensities

    B. Create the model using Sequential API

    Defines a Sequential model and the uses its add() method to add layers. The first layer is Flatten(input_shape=[])
    -add Dense() layers specifying number of neurons and activation function.
    -the final layer is also dense with 10 neurons and softmax activation

    The above can be streamlined into one process. Specifying the layers in a list to the Sequential constructor. 

    C. Compile the model

    compile() the model. specify loss, optimizer function, and optionally metrics. 

    D. Train model

    fit(). validation set is optional. metrics and loss evaluated after each epoch.
