# About

This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks of projects from **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras,
 & Tensorflow** (ISBN: 978-1492032649). This is one of top rated books on Amazon. This book covers both the mathematics and code of Machine Learning.
  The author [Aurelien Geron](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml) provides code
 he uses in his book in his [repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml). This study is self-guided and my strategy can be broken down
 into two branches:
 1. Conceptual
 2. Implementation

 ## Conceptual
 Study the chapter mathematically.

## Implementation
Disect, study, and recreate notebook from scratch.
