# About

This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks of projects from **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras,
 & Tensorflow** (ISBN: 978-1492032649). This is one of top rated books on Amazon. This book covers both the mathematics and code of Machine Learning.
  The author [Aurelien Geron](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml) provides code
 he uses in his book in his [repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml). This study is self-guided and my strategy can be broken down
 into two branches:
 1. Conceptual
 2. Implementation

 ## Conceptual
 Study the chapter mathematically. This is fairly straightforward as I did my undergrad in Math and Physics and have much experience
 in the prerequisites for ML.

## Implementation
My strategy is to apprentice myself to the author by disecting, studying, and recreating the author's code. The following
is a general overview of what I do. There's alot of back and forth involved between each step as well as side barring into 
supportive reading material. 
### 1. Disecting Code
Read lines of code and read docs on what each function, package, etc. does. 
### 2. Studying Code
Understand the code's workflow. Construct the big picture.
### 3. Reacreate Code
With the big picture. Reconstruct the project
