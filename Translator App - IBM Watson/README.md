# Simple Translator using IBM Watson

## Introduction
This script records 5 seconds of audio in English and translates it into Spanish speech.
Three (3) Watson services are used to perform this. The audio is transcribed
from English speech to English text. The English text is translated to Spanish text, which is
subsequently synthesized into Spanish speech.
