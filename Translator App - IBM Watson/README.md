# Translator using IBM Watson

## Introduction
This script records 5 seconds of audio in English and translates it into Spanish speech.
Three (3) Watson services are used to perform this. The audio is transcribed
from English speech to English text. The English text is translated to Spanish text, which is
subsequently synthesized into Spanish speech.

## Usage
The **keys.py** needs to be filled with API keys. You can get one by signing up for a free tier account
at IBM Watson's website. After API key fields are filled, run the script and follow the instructions to
record a 5 second audio segment (in English) for translation into Spanish.
